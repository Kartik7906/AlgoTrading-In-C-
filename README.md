# AlgoTrading-In-C++

# Significance of Algorithmic Trading:
generate consistent profits and reduce trading costs. It provides traders with a competitive edge in the market by enabling them to react quickly to market conditions and execute trades with precision.

# Algo Trading Edge with C++:
C++ is a powerful programming language that is widely used in the finance industry, including algorithmic trading. It offers high performance, low latency, and extensive libraries for data analysis and processing.
By learning C++ and its application in algorithmic trading, you will be equipped with the necessary skills to develop and implement sophisticated trading strategies. In this course, we will explore various concepts and techniques related to algo trading in C++, including networking, streaming and aggregated forex data, working with spreadsheets, and mathematical concepts like parabolic math, stochastic, linear regression, and standard deviation.
In the upcoming lessons, we will dive deeper into each topic to help you build a strong foundation in algo trading with C++.

# Networking in C++
Networking is a crucial aspect of algorithmic trading in C++. It involves communication between different software components or systems over a network. In this screen, we will explore various networking concepts in C++, including APIs and HTTP.

# APIs in C++
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) allow programs to communicate with external systems or services. APIs provide a set of functions and protocols that define how different software components can interact with each other. In the context of algorithmic trading, APIs are often used to retrieve market data, place orders, and manage trading strategies.

Here's a simple example of how you can make an API request in C++ using the curl library:
#include <iostream>
#include <curl/curl.h>

int main() {
  CURL *curl;
  CURLcode res;

  curl_global_init(CURL_GLOBAL_DEFAULT);

  curl = curl_easy_init();
  if (curl) {
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://api.example.com/endpoint");
    res = curl_easy_perform(curl);

    if (res != CURLE_OK)
      fprintf(stderr, "curl_easy_perform() failed: %s\n", curl_easy_strerror(res));

    curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
  }

  curl_global_cleanup();

  return 0;
}

#include <iostream> → standard C++ input/output.
#include <curl/curl.h> → header for libcurl, which gives you access to all its functions and constants.

CURL *curl; → This is a pointer to a CURL handle, like a “session” or “connection” object.
CURLcode res; → This stores the result/error code after performing the request. in other words we can say that this is an response just like in Nodejs

curl_global_init(CURL_GLOBAL_DEFAULT);
Initializes the libcurl library globally.
Think of this like setting up the environment before any requests.
It handles global states like SSL initialization, networking, etc.

curl = curl_easy_init();
Creates and returns a new CURL easy handle.
“Easy” means it’s the simple interface (libcurl also has “multi” interfaces for parallel connections).
If curl is not NULL, it means initialization succeeded.

# curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://api.example.com/endpoint");
curl_easy_setopt() → sets an option for this request.
CURLOPT_URL → tells libcurl which URL to send the request to.
So this line configures the request: “Hey curl, target this URL.”
There are hundreds of options (for headers, POST data, authentication, etc.)
